As a partner in Livid, he was responsible for making sure sure the Livid controllers can do something on a computer: trigger a sound, play a note, tweak a filter, playback a video, control a light, or facilitate the creation of something not yet imagined. Peter formed Livid with Jay Smith and Travis Redding to put live video performance on the stage, where his role was to direct the interaction and partnerships with many music software titles. Over the years, Livid transformed from a niche video mixing product to a company with a complete product line and global reach in music and media production.
