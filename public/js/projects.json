As a partner in Livid, he makes sure the Livid controllers can do something on a computer: trigger a sound, play a note, tweak a filter, playback a video, control a light, or facilitate the creation of something not yet imagined. Peter formed Livid with Jay Smith and Travis Redding to put live video performance on the stage. Over the years, Livid transformed from a niche video mixing product to a company with a complete product line and global reach in music and media production.

Typically, small LCDs are used to show parameter values and assignments of hardware controls of software parameters. LividLCD makes this much more flexible, acting as a webserver to turn any screen-with-a-browser into a parameter display.</p><p>This puts all the most relevant information front and center, letting the computer do the work and the artist do her job.</p>",

    "projectText": "In 2013, Livid needed to go beyond the tropes of DJ and remixing to create a MIDI controller for expressive production. Taking lead for the conceptual and interactive design, I knew we needed to move to pressure sensitive controls that could play percussion and tonal sounds with both hands, providing expressive dynamic range. Taking cues from historical and contemporary devices, we incorporated capacitive sensing controls to get rid of moving parts for continuous controls. The result is a new way to make music: a portable and playable device that combines the best of button-based controls, traditional drum pads, and mixing board production.",

The program was made using Cycling 74's Max and Jitter programs, organized by sophisticated JavaScript and SQL database technology.
