    "projectText" : "<p>Using a non-traditional 'music controller' (as opposed to a piano keyboard) for controlling and composing music offers a lot of creative potential. A lot of this potential resides in the ability to dynamically map a hardware button or slider to a musical function: pitch, filters, effects, and more.</p><p>Livid LCD is an ingenious solution for generating data displays for dynamic hardware controls. Typically, small LCDs are used to show parameter values and assignments of hardware controls of software parameters. LividLCD makes this much more flexible, acting as a webserver to turn any screen-with-a-browser into a parameter display. This was programmed with nodejs, jquery, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, using Open Sound Control (and MIDI in some cases) as a communication protocol. The app is distributed as runtime apps for OS X and Windows using the nwjs platform.</p>"

    "projectText" : "The challenge for Livid was to go beyond the DJ and remixing controller to create a production piece for expressive beat-making and synth playing. We wanted to create something portable and new that would work for a variety of musicians and their software. Leading the conceptual design, I knew we needed to move to pressure sensitive controls that could play percussion and tonal sounds with both hands providing expressive dynamic range. Taking cues from historical devices from Buchla, we incorporated capacitive sensitive controls so get rid of any moving parts for continuous controls. The result is a portable and playable device that combines the best of button-based controls, traditional drum pads, and mixing board production."

Cell DNA is the ultimate product of that legacy, incorporating ease of use in concept, but a deep ability to modify video clips on the fly with inventive OpenGL effects, comprehensive MIDI control, and rich media access. The program was made using Cycling 74's Max and Jitter programs, organized by sophisticated JavaScript and SQL database technology. It also incorporates a custom copy-protection scheme and web-based registration that I designed and implemented. I programmed, maintained, and supported this product largely as a solo effort within the Livid company."

Using system exclusive protocol, the settings and colors can be changed by the user, however, to make this usable for most, a GUI needs to be provided. As our controller product family grew, we needed to universalize all editing into a single program. Using web technologies, I designed and programmed an Editor system that would let customers communicate with our hardware using a browser. Programmed in JavaScript, Jquery, HTML, and CSS, the Livid Online Editor saved countless hours and provided instant convenience for customers by making it universally available. "

To test the viability of commonly available, inexpensive systems, I configured a Raspberry Pi to run Pure Data for easy prototyping, and created two different instruments - a bassline synthesizer and a drum sampler, each with unique sonic controls and sequencing. I also configured an Olinuxino A13 board to build run Pure Data to run some test patches as a comparison."

Designed to give a guitarist control over digital effects and recording from the 'horn' of the guitar, the Guitar Wing introduced a new way for guitarists to tweak, tone, and tape their sound. After a successful Kickstarter campaign to fund the production and introduce the product to the general public, we needed to fulfill the promise of allowing a huge variety of software to work seamlessly with the Guitar Wing. With the help of some remote programmers, I designed and delivered unique templates, interactive scripts, and content so guitarists could take full advantage of this unique device for expanding their sound."
