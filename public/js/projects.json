    "projectText": "<p>Using a non-traditional 'music controller' (as opposed to a piano keyboard) for controlling and composing music offers a lot of creative potential. A lot of this potential resides in the ability to dynamically map a hardware button or slider to a musical function: pitch, filters, effects, and more.</p><p>Livid LCD is an ingenious solution for generating data displays for dynamic hardware controls. Typically, small LCDs are used to show parameter values and assignments of hardware controls of software parameters. LividLCD makes this much more flexible, acting as a webserver to turn any screen-with-a-browser into a parameter display.</p><p>This was programmed with nodejs, jquery, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, using Open Sound Control (and MIDI in some cases) as a communication protocol. The app is distributed as runtime apps for OS X and Windows using the nwjs platform.</p>",

    "projectText": "In 2013, Livid needed to go beyond the tropes of DJ and remixing to create a MIDI controller for expressive production. Taking lead for the conceptual and interactive design, I knew we needed to move to pressure sensitive controls that could play percussion and tonal sounds with both hands, providing expressive dynamic range. Taking cues from historical and contemporary devices, we incorporated capacitive sensing controls so get rid of moving parts for continuous controls. The result is a portable and playable device that combines the best of button-based controls, traditional drum pads, mixing board production, and offers musicians a new way to make new music.",

The program was made using Cycling 74's Max and Jitter programs, organized by sophisticated JavaScript and SQL database toolsnology. It also incorporates a custom copy-protection scheme and web-based registration that I designed and implemented.

To test the viability of commonly available, inexpensive systems, I configured a Raspberry Pi to run Pure Data for easy prototyping, and created two different instruments - a bassline synthesizer and a drum sampler, each with unique sonic controls and sequencing. I also configured an Olinuxino A13 board to build run Pure Data to run some test programs as a comparison.
